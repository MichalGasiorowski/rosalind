Problem

A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every member 
of the collection. We say that a common substring is a longest common substring
if there does not exist a longer common substring. 
For example, "CG" is a common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGGTATA", 
but it is not as long as possible; in this case, "GTA" is a longest common 
substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA".

Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique; for a 
simple example, "AA" and "CC" are both longest common substrings of "AACC" and "CCAA".

Given: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.

Return: A longest common substring of the collection. 
(If multiple solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)
